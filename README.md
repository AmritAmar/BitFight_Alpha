BitFight_Alpha
==============

BitFight is a game created by SirHack3r for the IAGPC'13, and this is the first version of the game. All the code in here is currently being restructured for the Beta Version.

It is a 2D retro-style, simplistic game with the main motive of dodging enemies. The primary aim of the game is to dodge Enemy bits in a zero-graviy environment. Another Game Mode Currently Coming up is the Zombits Survival, where you have to fly your bit through hoardes of ZomBits!

This is the ALPHA Version of the game, and is currently in development by transferring all the code to the BETA version.
